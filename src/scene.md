# Scene Log

- **Signal**: Downtime drift at 05:42 UTC, automated scraper reported 1.8x drift from baseline.
- **Mood**: Quiet, leaning into improvisation while sipping leftover tea.
- **Plan**:
  1. Combine solar-powered sensor data with the note generator from `tools/mixchain.py`.
  2. Sketch a quick CLI to pick a random signal and attach a journal entry.
  3. Capture all of this in a rolling markdown note so that it can be committed nightly.

This log is intentionally rough; it follows the way a developer would jot down half-baked ideas before polishing them.
